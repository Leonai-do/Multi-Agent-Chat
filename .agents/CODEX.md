# THE MAKE IT WORK FIRST FIELD GUIDE

CORE TRUTH
Defensive code before functionality is theater.
Prove it works. Then protect it.

THE RULES
1. Build the Happy Path First – Code that DOES the thing
2. No Theoretical Defenses – Naked first version
3. Learn from Real Failures – Fix reality, not ghosts
4. Guard Only What Breaks – Add checks only for facts
5. Keep the Engine Visible – Action, not paranoia

ANTI-PATTERNS TO BURN
❌ Fortress Validation
❌ Defensive Exit Theater
❌ Connection State Paranoia

PATTERNS TO LIVE BY
✅ Direct Execution
✅ Natural Failure
✅ Continuous Progress

THE TEST
Can someone grok your code in 10 seconds?
YES → You lived the manifesto
NO  → Delete defenses

THE PROMISE
Readable. Debuggable. Maintainable. Honest.

THE METAPHOR
Don’t bolt on airbags before the engine runs.
First: make it move.
Then: guard against real crashes.

MAKE IT WORK FIRST.
MAKE IT WORK ALWAYS.
GUARDS EARN THEIR KEEP.

# CHANGES BETWEEN ORIGINAL MANIFESTO AND FIELD GUIDE

## Core Truth
- Original: "Every line of defensive code you write before proving your feature works is a lie..."
+ Field Guide: "Defensive code before functionality is theater. Prove it works. Then protect it."
(Phrased shorter, sharper, no metaphor drift.)

## Philosophy / Rules
- Original had 5 sections with long explanations (e.g. “Write code that does the thing. Not checks...”)
+ Field Guide reduced to 5 short rules, one line each.
(Compression: removed repetition, slogans instead of prose.)

## Anti-Patterns
- Original: Full code samples showing Fortress Validation, Defensive Exit Theater, Connection State Paranoia.
+ Field Guide: Only names listed with ❌ icons.
(Removed examples for poster readability.)

## Patterns We Embrace
- Original: Full code samples for Direct Execution, Natural Failure, Continuous Progress.
+ Field Guide: Only names listed with ✅ icons.
(Same compression—patterns as mantras.)

## Mindset Shift
- Original: "From: X → To: Y" contrasts across multiple lines.
+ Field Guide: Removed section entirely.
(The core shift is implied by the rules; stripped for brevity.)

## The Path
- Original: 5 steps (Write It, Run It, Break It, Guard It, Ship It).
+ Field Guide: Removed entirely.
(Field guide favors slogans, not process.)

## The Test
- Original: "Can someone read your code and understand what it does in 10 seconds?"
+ Field Guide: "Can someone grok your code in 10 seconds?"
(Simplified, kept essence.)

## The Promise
- Original: Bullet list: Readable, Debuggable, Maintainable, Honest (with explanations).
+ Field Guide: "Readable. Debuggable. Maintainable. Honest."
(Compressed into a chant-like line.)

## The Metaphor
- Original: "Don’t add airbags to a car that doesn’t have an engine yet..."
+ Field Guide: "Don’t bolt on airbags before the engine runs. First: make it move. Then: guard against real crashes."
(Metaphor shortened, same spirit.)

## Call to Action
- Original: Long section: "Stop writing code that apologizes... Stop defending... Stop hiding..."
+ Field Guide: 3 bold lines: "MAKE IT WORK FIRST. MAKE IT WORK ALWAYS. GUARDS EARN THEIR KEEP."
(Stripped to rallying cry.)ges
