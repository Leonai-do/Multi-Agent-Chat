## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### [ ✅ ] Task 7 - UI/UX Analysis and Planning
@/home/leonai-do/LeonAI_DO/dev/Multi-Agent Gemini Chat/Docs/Pending tasks.md Based on these pending tasks, please analyze the file and make a plan for all UI/UX improvements, just those for now, after that, please tell me your thougths on them, what can you do to make the app more usable, with soft animations, with transparent floating boxes, but being efficient with server and browser loading and memory and CPU efficient.

I need the app to become more simplistic, while being a better experience for the users throuhout the complete usage of the app.

I also need you to make a detailed plan to divide each file where the content is very long like the @/home/leonai-do/LeonAI_DO/dev/Multi-Agent Gemini Chat/index.css , reduce the lines by dividing the file into more manageable components to achieve a better mantainability and ease of debuging and refactor, while saving time to modify without needing to read the whole file at once.

### [ ✅ ] Task 8 - Internet Support Implementation
Add internet support to the multi chat app

### [ ✅ ] Task 33 - Build Path Clarity
Build path clarity: You have both Vite and a CDN import map setup (index.html). Ensure local dev and deployment paths are aligned (either bundle with Vite and drop CDN import map, or clearly document both paths).

---

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS TASKS

### [ 🔄 ] Task 6 - Thinking Visibility
Add thinking visibility to the app, so when any model that supports thinking, is thinking, the user can see the thinking process of the model, and the app shows the user the thinking process of the model, and then the user can see the final answer of the model in a separate box.

### [ 🔄 ] Task 14 - Thinking Mechanism Visibility
Add visibility to the thinking mechanism of the models

### [ 🔄 ] Task 17 - Internet Support Enhancement
Add Internet Support: Useful, but you'll want a tool layer + server proxy to avoid leaking API keys. Approach: add a "tools" adapter (search, fetch page, cite) and pass retrieved snippets into prompts. UI: toggle in settings with "include web results" and "max sources". Note: this front‑end only app needs a small backend for search APIs.

### [ 🔄 ] Task 22 - Thinking Visibility Enhancement
Thinking Visibility: Two parts: status + streaming. Status is there ("writing", "refining") in live view. Consider switching to streaming for token‑by‑token updates if the API supports it, and show per‑agent progress/timers. Avoid exposing chain‑of‑thought; instead show "reasoning in progress" intents and high‑level steps.

### [ 🔄 ] Task 25 - Remove Hard-coded Agent Count
Remove hard‑coded agent count: Replace Array(4) with a derived count or setting in src/components/App.tsx:40,100 and src/components/SettingsModal.tsx:65. Also adjust prompts that say "four agents."
Unify styling approach: The app uses global CSS (index.css) while CSS modules exist but aren't imported (src/components/*.module.css, src/styles/global.css). Choose one approach (likely global, given index.html) and delete unused modules to reduce confusion.

### [ 🔄 ] Task 32 - Title Generation Robustness
Title generation robustness: The title prompt is fine; consider truncation/sanitization and a small debounce or retry given occasional transient errors.

### [ 🔄 ] Task 38 - Accessibility Improvements
Accessibility: Ensure buttons have clear labels (many do), and improve focus rings for keyboard navigation.

## ⏳ PENDING TASKS

### 🎨 User Interface & Experience

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 1 - Multi-line Support
Add multi-line support to the app, when the users are writing a message, they must be able to write multiple lines of text by using ctl+enter or shit+enter, and send the message by using enter.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 2 - Stop Button
Add an stop button to stop the generation of the response from the agents.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 5 - Copy Buttons for Agent Responses
Add a copy button for both inital and refined response from the agents, in the agent box, and in the collaboration trace view.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 9 - Text Rendering Fix
Fix the text rendering in the multi chat app

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 10 - Copy Button Implementation
Add a copy button for both inital and refined response from the agents

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 12 - Horizontal Scroll Bar Fix
Fix the horizontal scroll bar to make all line show when raw content is displayed

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 13 - Theme Color Palette
Add more colors with a color pallete for the themes

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 16 - Better UI Structure
Add a better UI with clear icon or logo, name and separation between new conversation and the conversation list, the new conversation button must be shorter and separated from the header, but on the top of the UI

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 18 - Text Rendering Enhancement
Fix Text Rendering: Tidy up Markdown and raw view. Specifically change raw view to use horizontal scroll instead of wrapping: index.css:633 uses white-space: pre-wrap; prefer white-space: pre; overflow-x: auto. Tables/links can render better by styling table elements and adding target="_blank" for links via ReactMarkdown components in src/components/MessageItem.tsx.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 19 - Copy Buttons for Initial/Refined
Copy Buttons for Initial/Refined: Straightforward. Add a copy button to agent boxes in both live and trace views: src/components/AgentBox.tsx (both AgentBox and TraceAgentBox). Reuse the logic in src/components/CodeBlock.tsx for consistent UX.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 20 - Raw View Horizontal Scroll
Raw View Horizontal Scroll: See item 9. Change index.css:633-642 to white-space: pre; overflow-x: auto; so long lines don't wrap/crop. The CSS module version src/components/MessageItem.module.css already has the correct pattern; the app uses global CSS now.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 21 - More Theme Colors
More Theme Colors: You already centralize tokens in index.css and src/styles/global.css. Add accent palettes (e.g., brand, neutral, solarized variants) and expose them in src/components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx as selectable presets. Also add more agent colors and map --agent-N-color dynamically based on team size.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 24 - Better UI Structure Enhancement
Better UI Structure: Tighter header (logo/name), smaller "New Chat" button separated above the chat list, clearer sectioning. A compact top bar + sidebar grouping would improve scanability. Add per‑message actions grouping and more visual separation for collaboration trace.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 35 - Keyboard UX
Keyboard UX: Shift+Enter for newline, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to send, Esc to close modals.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 36 - Message Actions
Message actions: Add "Regenerate" for last turn, "Copy all" for model messages, and "Delete message".

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 37 - Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting: Add rehype-highlight for code blocks in Markdown.
Virtualized message list: For long histories, use list virtualization to keep scrolling smooth.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 41 - Agent Instruction Box Improvements
Make the agent's instruction box collapsable, separate their names in the boxes by adding a padding, since the names are too close to the content. of the box.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 62 - Chat Panel Glass Card
Center the chat surface in a single column and wrap the message list + input in a glassmorphism card (backdrop blur, semi‑transparent bg, subtle border/shadow). Constrain max width (900–1100px) for readability.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 63 - Message Card Redesign
Add a small header row to model/user messages: left = sender name, right = timestamp; include a small provider badge (e.g., Gemini/Groq). Keep current Markdown rendering, unify bubble spacing, and ensure code blocks align visually.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 64 - Code Block & Copy Unification
Unify code block styling (monospace, subtle bg, rounded corners) and reuse the same copy affordance and feedback across messages and agent boxes for consistency.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 65 - Input Bar UX & States
Implement Shift+Enter for newline and Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to send; add a spinner + “Sending…” label on the button and a disabled state during processing; add a small hint below the input about shortcuts.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 66 - Status & Error Row
Add a compact status/error row beneath the chat card to surface connection/provider errors and run state using high‑contrast boxes (non‑blocking, dismissible).

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 67 - Typographic & Spacing Polish
Normalize section titles, labels, helper text, and vertical rhythm across chat and settings (uniform gaps, dividers) to improve scannability.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 68 - Theme Tokens & Accent Consolidation
Introduce an --accent color (indigo) and shared tokens for focus rings, shadows, and card backgrounds; apply across inputs, selects, buttons, and badges for a cohesive look.

### 🔧 File Upload & Media Support

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 3 - Agent-Specific File Upload
Add file upload support to each, specific agent, to provide any image, if the target model supports it, pdf, text or code file that the agents can use to answer the user query.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 4 - App File Upload Support
Add file upload support to the app, to provide any pdf, text or code file that the agents can use to answer the user query.

### 🤖 Agent Management

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 11 - Agent Number Definition
Add an agent number definition to the app, to add more to the team

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 26 - Agent Number Definition Enhancement
Agent Number Definition: Good enhancement. The agent count is hard‑coded in multiple places: src/components/App.tsx:40,100, src/components/SettingsModal.tsx:65. Introduce AGENT_COUNT in src/constants.ts (or a setting), derive state arrays from it, and update SettingsModal to render dynamic instruction editors.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 61 - Dynamic Agent Management with Aggregator
Dynamic Agent Management: Add the ability for users to dynamically add/remove agents with a button interface. Each agent should have customizable system instructions. The last agent in the team will serve as an aggregator and judge, compiling all responses from other agents and deciding what to keep in the final output. This includes: UI for adding/removing agents, dynamic agent configuration, aggregator role assignment, and intelligent response synthesis logic.

### 🔌 Provider & Model Support

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 15 - Different Model Providers
Add different model providers to the app

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 23 - Different Model Providers Implementation
Different Model Providers: Worth it. Add a provider interface (generate, model, systemInstruction) and adapters for Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. Settings should allow selecting provider/model and configuring API keys (prefer backend storage). Centralize the client in a src/llm/provider.ts to decouple UI from SDKs.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 60 - Provider API Key Management
When the user selects one provider, the api key for that provider is requested, and saved in the local storage, and used for all the requests to that provider. Each provider must have a different api key, and the user must be able to select the provider and enter the api key for that provider, with a box for each provider.

### 🏗️ Code Architecture & Refactoring

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 27 - Raw Text View Wrapping
Raw text view wrapping: Update index.css:633-642 as noted to use horizontal scroll. This addresses the "all line show" feedback for raw content.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 28 - Consistent Markdown Rendering
Consistent Markdown rendering: In src/components/MessageItem.tsx, consider adding components for links (a), tables, and list spacing. For Agent live/trace (src/components/AgentBox.tsx), you currently override pre → fragment; that can break code block layout. Prefer consistent pre/code blocks with the same rules used in messages.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 29 - Provider Abstraction
Provider abstraction: Extract Gemini calls out of src/components/App.tsx into a provider. This simplifies adding providers (item 15) and testing. Also enables adding tools (item 8) without touching UI.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 30 - Abort/Stop Generation
Abort/stop generation: Wire AbortController through the provider so a "Stop" button can cancel in‑flight calls; aligns with better UX and prevents duplicate updates.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 31 - Batch State Updates
Batch state updates: Inside runAgentCollaboration you call setCurrentCollaborationState multiple times during Promise.all. Consider buffering updates per agent and applying in fewer renders to reduce UI churn.
Settings extensibility: src/components/SettingsModal.tsx currently manages only initial instructions. Make it data‑driven so it can handle agent count, model/provider selection, and toggles for web tools without new component logic.

### 📊 Data Management & Export

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 34 - Export/Import Chats
Export/import chats: Add JSON export/import for localStorage data to aid portability.

### 🛠️ Error Handling & Analytics

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 39 - Error Surfacing
Error surfacing: Replace generic error message with a visible banner that suggests checking settings/API keys.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 40 - Analytics/Telemetry
Analytics/telemetry (optional): Basic client‑side metrics for generation duration per agent and errors.

### 🧩 Component Architecture

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 42 - Reusable UI Components
Create reusable UI components (StopButton, CopyButton, TextInput, ChatInput, MessageToolbar, RawTextPanel, AgentBoxBase, CollaborationTraceGrid) and refactor to use them.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 43 - Generation Controller
Introduce GenerationController with AbortController and event emitter (isGenerating, stop, onProgress) to coordinate runs and cancellations.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 44 - Collaboration Orchestrator
Extract collaboration orchestrator into src/agents/collaborationOrchestrator.ts (search → initial → refine → synthesize) with abort checks and progress callbacks.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 45 - LLM Provider SPI
Define LLMProvider SPI and ProviderRegistry with capability flags (streaming, vision, functionCalling); implement geminiProvider adapter.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 46 - Tools Layer
Add Tools layer with a unified Tool interface (Search, FetchPage, Cite) supporting abort signals; design for optional server proxy.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 47 - RAG Substrate
Implement RAG substrate: interfaces for DocumentStore, Chunker, Embedder, Retriever with an in-memory default.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 48 - File Upload RAG Integration
Hook file uploads into RAG: parse → chunk → embed → store; retrieve top-k passages and inject into prompts with citations.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 49 - Vision Support
Add Vision support: image attachments in messages, provider gating for vision models, drag/drop UI with previews.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 50 - CSS File Splitting
Split index.css into partials (tokens.css, theme.css, layout.css, chat.css, message.css, agent.css, controls.css) and import them.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 51 - Settings Modal Schema
Make Settings modal schema-driven; add provider/model selection, agent count, and toggles for Internet, RAG, and Vision.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 52 - Feature Flag Service
Implement feature flag service and UI gating based on provider capabilities and settings.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 53 - Backend Proxy Endpoints
Add optional backend proxy endpoints for tools/providers to protect API keys; keep front-end SPI stable.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 54 - Streaming Token Support
Add streaming token support in UI when provider supports it; show per-agent progress/timers.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 55 - Contract Tests
Add contract tests for Provider and Tool interfaces; unit tests for orchestrator ordering/abort and keyboard shortcuts.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 56 - Debug Mode
Add Debug mode to log orchestrator events and tool invocations to a dev panel/console.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 57 - Bounded Concurrency
Add bounded concurrency for agent phases and batch state updates to reduce UI churn.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 58 - Code Splitting
Code-split heavy/optional views and libraries (e.g., collaboration trace, markdown parsing) for faster initial load.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 59 - Architecture Documentation
Document architecture and extension points (providers, tools, RAG, vision) to guide future modules.

### ⚙️ Settings & Configuration

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 69 - Providers Tab Section‑Cards
Finalize Providers & Models into three section‑cards: (1) API Keys with Save & Test, (2) Global Defaults (Provider/Model), (3) Agents Grid (per‑agent Provider/Model). Add concise helper text.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 70 - Sidebar Icons & Tab Persistence
Add icons to settings sidebar items and persist the last opened tab in localStorage; restore it when reopening Settings.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 71 - Refresh Models & Apply Global
Add “Refresh models” next to Global Model and an “Apply Global to All Agents” action to propagate model choice quickly.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 72 - Agent Name Preview & Validation
Show a one‑line preview (“You are {name}…”) under each instruction textarea; validate names (non‑empty, reasonable length) with inline feedback.

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 73 - Collapsible Settings Sections
Make API Keys, Global Defaults, and Agents collapsible with remembered state to reduce vertical scrolling on smaller screens.

### 🧪 Quality & Tests

#### [ ⏳ ] Task 74 - E2E Coverage for New UX
Add Playwright tests for: glass chat card present; message header/badge; input spinner state on send; keyboard shortcuts; settings navigation with tab persistence; refresh models/apply‑global; provider badge rendering.
