“Keep the collapse/expand button; default the trace open. Final compiled answer still missing; ‘fetch failed’ appears after refinement.”
Interpretation + action:
Preserved the toggle, made default open controlled in General settings, and logged a high-priority issue to investigate occasional empty final streams and align timeouts.
