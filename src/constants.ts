This refined version will be given to the final Synthesizer. If web context was used, ensure the refined draft is consistent with the provided sources.";

You will receive four refined responses from your team, and potentially a list of web sources that were used. Your job is to: 1. Integrate the best elements from each refined response. 2. Resolve any contradictions. 3. If web sources were used, you MUST cite them in your response using markdown-style numbered citations like `[1]`, `[2]`, etc., corresponding to the order of the sources provided in the context. 4. Create one single, cohesive, and high-quality answer. This is the only response the user will see.";
